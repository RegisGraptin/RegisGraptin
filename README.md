ðŸ‘‹ Hi. I am a french engineer looking to solve complex problems.

I describe myself as a Machine Learning Engineer, as it is one of the areas where I am the most proficient and I want to become in the future a reference in this domain. However, I do not hesitate to look over other domains. 

I am currently learning Reinforcement Learning and Blockchain (Ethereum and Cosmos SDK). 

You can see some of my work on this repository. Else, I would suggest you to have a look on my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rerere) account.

If you want to keep in touch, feel free to contact me via [linkedin](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/regis-graptin/en).
